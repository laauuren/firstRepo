    <h1>My College Experience!</h1>

    <p>My college journey has been quite the rollercoaster! After graduating high school in 2021, I first attended Hunter College for my freshman 
    year with plans to major in nursing. At the time, I also began working as an afterschool counselor in my old elementary school for the 
    kindergarten group, which I really enjoyed and taught me a lot about myself. At the end of my first year, I realized that for as much as 
    I loved working at my job, it was challenging for me to balance both work and school. I also realized how much dedication is truly required to do 
    well in school, especially for a major like nursing so I began to look at other majors and colleges, which brought me to City Tech for communication design.
    My sophomore year was a cool experience, I was still pretty shy around my classmates but I met a lot of really passionate professors that taught me a lot about 
    design and the industry. Last year during my junior year, I definitely began opening up a lot more and making friends with my fellow designers. I also began working at another afterschool 
    program, and once again I really struggled to balance work and school life. This year, I started the semester a lot more motivated and prepared to approach my studies with dedication
    than previous years, but very early into the semester, personal stuff began to affect my motivation and I began having very familiar struggles with my mental health and wellness.
    I've been having to do a lot of self reflection on who I am as an individual and as a student. I'm realizing that applying myself academically is not something that 
    comes easily to me, especially when I have other challenges going on in life, and it will take me longer than 4 years to get my bachelor's. For a long time, I felt bad about that, 
    but I'm becoming more accepting of the fact that not everyone will have the same journey, and it is okay for me to go at my own pace if it means I'm taking better care of myself. 
    Overall, my college experience is very connected to my self discovery process, and I'm very thankful for all the lessons that I've learned in adulthood ^.^ 

    <br> Even though I've been at this school for three years already, I meet new people every semester and it's refreshing to see 
    famililar and new faces when I walk into my classes. I've also learned something useful in EVERY class, especially in this major--whether it 
    be with design/career advice, or just overall great life advice!</p>
